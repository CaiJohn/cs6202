Installation
------------

The following sections briefly describe where and how to install Emacs
on the most common systems. We recommend you install Emacs version 24.
If your system is not listed here you might find help on installing
Emacs in the official `Emacs documentation`__ or that of your host
system.

.. __: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html


Windows
^^^^^^^

Windows users can use the `official windows binary`__.  Download the
zip-file and unpack it to your desired install location. No further
installation should be necessary. More information on installation and
setup can be found in the `README`__ file.

Try it out: Run ``bin/emacs.exe`` from the emacs installation
folder. Emacs should open. Press :kbd:`Control + x`, :kbd:`Control +
c` and answer `y` to close it again.
To install Emacs shortcuts in your menu run ``bin/addpm.exe``.

.. removing alternative, since it behaved odd on some machines
   Alternatively you can use a specially packaged EmacsW32__
   distribution.

Max OS X
^^^^^^^^

OS X users can find a "vanilla" `Emacs for OS X`__ which we recommend
using. Alternatively `Carbon Emacs`__ and `Aquamacs`__ are variants of Emacs
customized specifically for OS X.

Linux etc.
^^^^^^^^^^

\*nix users should use the package manager of their host system.

* Ubuntu and Debian based systems: ``sudo apt-get install emacs``
* RedHat and Suse based systems: ``sudo yum install emacs``
* etc...



Setup
^^^^^

After installing Emacs, you should configure it by adding the
following to `.emacs` which is your user configuration file for
Emacs.

* Open `~/.emacs` by pressing :kbd:`Control + x` and then
  :kbd:`Control + f`.

* Now type in exactly ``~/.emacs`` and hit return.

This will open up your `.emacs` file which is most likely empty. Paste
the following code into the buffer by pressing :kbd:`Control + y`::

  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)  ; dont show the GNU splash screen
  (transient-mark-mode t)           ; show selection from mark
  (setq visible-bell 1)             ; turn off bip warnings
  (show-paren-mode t)               ; turn on highlight paren mode
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)     ; use y and n for questions
  (global-font-lock-mode t)         ; enable syntax highlighting
  (iswitchb-mode 1)                 ; better buffer switching

Now save the file by pressing :kbd:`Control + x` and then
:kbd:`Control + s`.  From now on we will refer to the above sequence
as :kbd:`C-x C-s`, or in short :kbd:`C-x-s`.



Scheme Mode for Emacs
---------------------

Emacs ships with an editing mode for Scheme files. If your Emacs is
older then version 22 we recommend you upgrade it. (You can get the
version with :kbd:`M-x version RET`, ie, :kbd:`Alt + x`, type version
and hit return).


Setup
^^^^^

The following assumes that you have installed Scheme as described in
:ref:`sec-petite`.

Save the `scheme-setup.el <_static/scheme-setup.el>`_ file to your
system and copy-paste the following into your ``~/.emacs`` file::

  (setq scheme-program-name "petite")
  (load-file                "C:/path/to/scheme-setup.el")

The ``/path/to/`` should be updated to the actual location of the
petite executable and the scheme-setup.el file and it should use
forward slashes ``/`` to separate directories.

After setup you should restart Emacs for the changes to take
effect. (Or if you would rather not restart, run: :kbd:`M-x load-file
RET ~/.emacs RET`.)

Usage
^^^^^

To start Scheme inside Emacs run: :kbd:`M-x run-scheme RET`
[#meta]_. This should open a new window with a running Scheme
interpreter::

If you do not see the banner and the prompt above, there is an error
in your installation.

The Schemed mode defines several useful features for programming
Scheme.  Here is a quick listing:

* :kbd:`C-c C-b` --- send entire buffer to the Scheme interpreter
* :kbd:`C-c d`   --- send preceding definition to the Scheme interpreter
* :kbd:`C-M-f`   --- move forward one S-expression
* :kbd:`C-M-b`   --- move backward one S-expression
* :kbd:`C-M-k`   --- kill the next S-expression (:kbd:`C-y` to yank it)
* :kbd:`C-M-t`   --- transpose the next S-expression with the previous one

More can be found through the help system with :kbd:`C-h m`.


.. [#meta] ``M`` refers the *Alt*-key and is pronounced *meta*.
           ``RET`` refers to the enter or return key.
